Each day the English it's more requested on job interviews, networks for example. I've a little experience with this, let's me tell about.

There was a day that I need to talk to a dev. team from China, and guess what? I don't speak Chinese (yet, I learn today.), so how I can communicate with them? The answer it's in the title, the English. But the history end here?</br>**WRONG DUDE!!!** They don't speak English too, but we managed to do it, anyway...
